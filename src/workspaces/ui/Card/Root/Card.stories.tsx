				Actually you are correct. I have not yet been convinced that dynamic definition of mixins is a good idea.
				However the issue you linked to was about including a mixin using a dynamic name. Which I am for. The OP's
				problem is solved better by accepting an argument to a single mixin instead of defining a unique mixin for each
				icon.
